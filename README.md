## Installing and Running Python

> This section is needed for all of the beginner lessons, and some of the wrangler lessons. If you already have a recent version of Python installed then you're ready to go.

### - Install the latest python

You can find OSX python installers on the [**official site**](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/). Follow the `"Latest Python 3 Release"` link at the top of the page, and then scroll down to download the `"macOS. 64-bit installer"`.

In particular, the installer for 64-bit Python 3.7.4 (latest stable at the time of writing) is here: [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-macosx10.9.pkg](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-macosx10.9.pkg)

1. Download and install in OSX
2. Open a terminal and check that it's installed with `python3 -V`

_For beginner lessons only:_

3. Install Jupyter with `python3 -m pip install jupyter`

* **_Pros_**: no installation of anything required
* **_Cons_**: only on an internet connection, and you can't save your progress

### - Install Anaconda **_(recommended for non-techies)_**

1. Open anaconda
2. Click on the 'Jupyter Notebook' tile
3. When the terminal launches, type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter.
4. An internet browser should open up displaying your home folder
5. Navigate to the place where you saved the .ipynb files and click into it

* **_Pros_**: No internet required to run, can save changes locally
* **_Cons_**: Anaconda is massive to install, and is a little confusing to use

## The Lessons

_This list will be updated as more lessons are written_

### Beginner

**Note**: These lessons do not start from ground 0, there are a few bits of prior knowledge that are assumed

1. Creating variables
2. Creating lists
3. Using a for loop
4. Using an if statement

Lessons will be added for these in the future.

1. Collections (`lists` & `dictionaries`)
2. OOP Basic Into (making a simple object)

### Wranglers

This set of lessons are aimed at briefly covering many relevant topics in turn, rather than focusing in-depth on each subject for a longer period.

The aim is to help data wranglers become as effective as possible, as fast as possible.
