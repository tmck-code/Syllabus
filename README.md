## Installing and Running

> There are a few choices for running the Jupyter notebooks, and each have their pros and cons.

These are the two easiest options:

1. **(Recommended)** Install anaconda and run through the Jupyter Notebook section

    1. Open anaconda
    2. Click on the 'Jupyter Notebook' tile
    3. When the terminal launches, type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter.
    4. An internet browser should open up displaying your home folder
    5. Navigate to the plac where you saved the .ipynb files and click into it

    **_Pros_**: No internet required to run, can save changes locally

    **_Cons_**: Anaconda is massive to install, and is a little confusing to use



2. Run from the github repository at [https://github.com/tmck-code/Syllabus](https://github.com/tmck-code/Syllabus)

    You can navigate to one of the .ipynb files and use in github on the net.

    **_Pros_**: no installation of anything required

    **_Cons_**: only on an internet connection, and you can't save your progress

> Overall I'd recommend number **2**, as it's the most flexible and works offline.
